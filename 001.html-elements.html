<h1>Hello World</h1>

<!--Do you see the code in your text editor that says <h1>Hello</h1>? That's an HTML element.
Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.
Opening tags look like this: <h1>
Closing tags look like this: </h1>
Note that the only difference between opening tags and closing tags is that closing tags have 
a slash after their opening angle bracket.-->
