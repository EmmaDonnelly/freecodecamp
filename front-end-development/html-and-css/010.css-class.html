<!--Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.
Here's an example CSS class declaration:
  <style>
    .blue-text {
      color: blue;
    }
  </style>
You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style> tag.
You can apply a class to an HTML element like this:
  <h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
Note that in your CSS style element, classes should start with a period. 
In your HTML elements' class declarations, classes shouldn't start with a period.-->
